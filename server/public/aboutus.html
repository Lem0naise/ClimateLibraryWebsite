                            <h3>•</h3> To enable those at the frontlines of the climate and nature crisis to tell their story directly and easily to a global audience. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            <h3>•</h3> To amplify the voices of those who are often less heard, or not heard at all. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            <h3>•</h3> To build solidarity and connections between individuals and grassroots movements and to encourage seeing the world through the lenses of others.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <h3>•</h3> We aim to develop a network of collaborators around the world with whom we can co-create this project.
                            <br/><br/><br/>

                            <h2>Possible future developments:</h2>
                            <br/><br/>
                            <h3>•</h3> <b>Create a platform of artistic responses to the stories </b>, making art which in itself further raises awareness of the reality of how the climate crisis is interwoven with other social inequities.
                            <br/><br/>
                            <h3>•</h3> <b>Lead to the co-creation of research and activism surrounding issues of local justice. </b>
                            <br/><br/>


                        <h2>Why focus on climate?</h2>
                        <br/><br/>
                        We see the climate crisis as just one of many symptoms of a current way of being, particularly by a global minority. A way of being in the world that has also caused, and is causing, other forms of social injustice. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        As part of wider forms of unfair disadvantage, the climate crisis is one of the symptoms that affects all of us but in different ways. It connects us globally and, in doing so, it is an issue that can be used to connect with other health and wellbeing inequities, entangled with the climate crisis, which will differ for individuals from different localities and
backgrounds.
