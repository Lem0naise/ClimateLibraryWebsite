                    <h2>①</h2> To give a voice to those who often go unheard - children, elders, substistence farmers, factory workers, ordinary people all around the world.<br/>
                    <h2>②</h2> To inspire artistic responses to these real-life stories from schools, groups and individuals in order to deepen understanding and to spark conversation and wider awareness of the crisis.

                    <h1 id="team">Meet the Team</h1>
                    We are a small team of teachers and scientists from the UK who care passionately about communicating the reality of the climate crisis and the ecological crisis.

                    <br/><br/><h2>Juliet Nolan</h2> <br/> Juliet is a Geographer turned Primary School teacher, with a stint as a children's book editor along the way. She believes in the power of storytelling and and art to spark empathy and understanding - and hopefully to prompt action. You can also find her on Twitter / X as @MPForNature.

                    <br/><br/><h2>Jennie Lord</h2> <br/>Jennie is an ecologist working in global health research. She specialises in diseases that are caused by pathogens transmitted to humans by insects. Studying these pathogens that have insect vectors means considering climate, nature and society because their cycle of transmission and resulting disease is influenced by temperature, rainfall, water sources, wildlife, livestock and agricultural systems, and social conditions. The root causes of the severity of vector-borne disease outbreaks are often the same as the root causes of the climate crisis; our current global economic system, imperialism and extractivism. Jennie therefore hopes she can work collaboratively with others to gesture toward alternative futures, as without addressing root causes, any effect of a single control strategy for a single vector-borne disease will be overwhelmed by wider consequences of the climate, nature and societal crisis.

                    <br/><br/><h2>Advisory Group</h2><br/> An advisory group from other countries which are on the frontlines of the climate crisis are helping us shape this project to that it is as useful as possible to as many people as possible. The eventually third aim ?? is for the Climate Stories Library to become a tool for collaboration between countries and activism.
