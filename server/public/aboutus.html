                                <h2>Jennie Lord</h2> Jennie is an ecologist working in global health research. She specialises in diseases that are caused by pathogens transmitted to humans by insects. Studying these pathogens that have insect vectors means considering climate, nature and society because their cycle of transmission and resulting disease is influenced by temperature, rainfall, water sources, wildlife, livestock and agricultural systems, and social conditions. The root causes of the severity of vector-borne disease outbreaks are often the same as the root causes of the climate crisis; our current global economic system, imperialism and extractivism. Jennie therefore hopes she can work collaboratively with others to gesture toward alternative futures, as without addressing root causes, any effect of a single control strategy for a single vector-borne disease will be overwhelmed by wider consequences of the climate, nature and societal crisis.                          </div>
