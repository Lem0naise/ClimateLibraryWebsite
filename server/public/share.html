                    - Record a video on a device, eg a phone <br/>
                    - Try to limit background noise <br/>
                    - Keep it concise, ~2 minutes maximum, upload more if you have more to say! <br/>
                    - Start it by saying your name, where you're from, and what you're talking about <br/><br/>
                    <h2 class="block">FAQs</h2>
                    <span class="q">Which language should my story be in?</span> <br/>
                    - Your own language. If you are able to, you can also translate it to English / Spanish / French in the video, or provide a translated description, so that your story is accessible to more people. <br/><br/>
                    <span class="q">Will my story be used for other purposes?</span> <br/>
                    - If a school or organisation is interested in using your story to inspire art or events, we will let you know. Similarly if we featured your story in our "Contact a Politician" series we will ask you beforehand. <br/><br/>
                    <span class="q">My story seems unimportant compared to disasters happening in other countries!</span> <br/>
                    - No story is too small to be held in the Climate Stories Library. Our aim is to build a vast collection from the tiniest of local variations one person may have observed over decades in their garden, to the changing of livelihoods and treasured ways of life at the frontlines of the climate crisis. <br/>
